## Title
This is my README generator. 

## Description
This application creates a README from user input. 
Technologies involved were Inquirer, node.js,  as well the file system module., or "fs".
I'm still working on getting the license link to display properly but will have a fix soon.

## Installation 
Simply run node index.js and the scripts will run, generating a README file from the input provided. 

## Credits 
I worked on this project alone but had an important leap of help from our teacher in office hours.
